                     Ruby-WordNet Installation Instructions
             $Id$

These instructions are decidedly Unix-biased. I apologize to those of you trying
to run this on some other platform. Suggestions or patches for other-platform
compatibility are welcome at <ged@FaerieMUD.org>.


Prerequisites
-------------

Versions listed are the ones I've tested with. Earlier versions may work, but
your mileage may vary.

* Ruby (>= 1.8.6)
  Home page: http://www.ruby-lang.org/
  Download: ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.6.tar.gz

* WordNet (>= 3.0)
  Home page: http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/

* bdb (>=0.2.5)
  RAA: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa-list.rhtml?name=bdb
  Download: ftp://moulon.inra.fr/pub/ruby/


Installation
------------

These instructions assume that you've already installed the prerequisite
packages, unpacked the distribution somewhere, and have changed your working
directory to the resultant subdirectory.

You must first convert the WordNet lexicon into the database format used by
Ruby-WordNet. The <datadir> argument is the full path to the 'dict' directory
under the WordNet installation:

  $ ruby convertdb.rb <datadir>

This can take some time, and will consume about ~40 Mb of disk space when the
process is finished. While it is building, it can consume a bit more.

To run unit tests:

  $ ruby test.rb

To install:

  $ ruby install.rb


Documentation
-------------

If you have Rdoc (http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/) installed, you can create HTML
documentation thusly:

 $ ruby docs/makedocs.rb

This will leave HTML documentation (by default) in 'docs/html'.
