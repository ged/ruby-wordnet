These instructions are decidedly Unix-biased. I apologize to those of you trying
to run this on some other platform. Suggestions or patches for other-platform
compatibility are welcome at <ged@FaerieMUD.org>.


Prerequisites
-------------

Versions listed are the ones I've tested with. Earlier versions may work, but
your mileage may vary.

* Ruby (>= 1.6.5)
  Home page: http://www.ruby-lang.org/
  Download: ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.6.5.tar.gz

* WordNet (>= 1.7)
  Home page: http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/
  Download: http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/obtain/

* Lingua::Wordnet (for now)
  CPAN: http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Lingua-Wordnet

  You don't actually need to install the Perl module -- you just have to run the
  'converdb.pl' program in the distribution's 'scripts' directory to build the
  necessary databases.

* bdb (>=0.2.5)
  RAA: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa-list.rhtml?name=bdb
  Download: ftp://moulon.inra.fr/pub/ruby/


Installation
------------

These instructions assume that you've already installed the prerequisite
packages, unpacked the distribution somewhere, and have changed your working
directory to the resultant subdirectory.

To run unit tests (requires RubyUnit >= 0.5):

  $ ruby test.rb

To install:

  $ ruby install.rb


Documentation
-------------

If you have Rdoc (http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/) installed, you can create HTML
documentation thusly:

 $ rdoc lib

This will leave HTML documentation in 'doc'.
